//A very basic config used by the Portable NPC System to configure various settings regarding the plugin.

"settings"
{
	"max_npcs"					"-1"		//The maximum number of NPCs active at any given time. Anything below zero means there is no limit.
	
	"npc_limit_method"			"0"			//If there is a limit to the number of active NPCs: how should the limit be enforced?
											//0 or lower: Prevent new NPC spawns while at the limit.
											//1 or higher: Kill the oldest NPC if a new NPC is spawned above the limit.
	
	"npc_max_gibs"				"-1"		//The maximum number of NPC gibs on the map at any given time. Anything below zero means there is no limit. Gibs spawned above the limit will simply delete the oldest gibs.
	
	"npc_attachments_max"		"-1"		//The maximum number of models attached to any given NPC. Anything below zero means there is no limit.
	
	"npc_particles_max"			"-1"		//The maximum number of particles attached to any given NPC. Anything below zero means there is no limit.
	
	"npc_health_bars"			"0"			//Determines the type of health bar displayed above NPC's heads.
											//Below 0: Visual health bars are blocked entirely.
											//0: Visual health bars are turned off by default, but can be enabled on specific NPCs via the "health_bar" setting in their configs.
											//1: Visual health bars are displayed using the "health/max health" format. Example: "HP: 100/125"
											//2: Visual health bars are displayed as a percentage. Example: "HP: 50%"
											//Above 2: Visual health bars are displayed using a bar. Example: "HP: "▓▓▓▓▒░░░"
	
	"npc_health_bars_display"	"0"			//If NPCs have visual health bars: who can see them?
											//Below 0: Everyone.
											//0: Customizable for each specific NPC via the "health_bar_display" setting in their config.
											//1: Only allies.
											//2: Only enemies.
											//3: Only players who have damaged the NPC within the past 3 seconds.
											//4 or higher: 3 + 1.
	
	"npc_killfeed"				"1"			//Should NPCs show up in the kill feed?
											//0 or lower: No.
											//1 or higher: Yes.
											
	"npc_default_name"			"Combatant"	//The default name to use for NPCs who do not have a specified name.
	
	"custom_melee_hitreg"		"1"			//The Portable NPC System overrides TF2's melee hitreg to fix a bug where hitting NPCs with melee always sounds like hitting a wall.
											//This setting allows server owners to toggle this custom hitreg on/off, though there's rarely any reason to do this as the custom hitreg works identically to TF2's normal hitreg.
											//0 or lower: Disable custom hitreg.
											//1 or higher: Enable custom hitreg.
											
	"custom_explosion_logic"	"1"			//The Portable NPC System overrides TF2's explosions to fix a bug where NPCs block explosion line-of-sight, effectively nullifying explosions entirely.
											//This setting allows server owners to toggle this custom explosion logic on/off, though, again, there's rarely any reason to do this as the custom explosions work identically to TF2's normal explosions.
											//Note that this disabling this does not disable any of the explosion natives/forwards, so developers can still take advantage of those. 
											//Disabling this just prevents TF2's "real" explosions from being replaced by the Portable NPC System's custom explosions.
											//0 or lower: Disable custom explosion logic.
											//1 or higher: Enable custom explosion logic.
