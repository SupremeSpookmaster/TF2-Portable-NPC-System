# *Introducing (eventually) the Portable NPC System!*
TODO: Write this.

## *Installation Guide*
TODO: Write this.

## *Prerequisites*
- **[SourceMod V1.12+](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=dev)**
- **[CBaseNPC](https://github.com/TF2-DMB/CBaseNPC?tab=readme-ov-file)**

## *Special thanks to...*
- **[Artvin](https://github.com/artvin01)** and **[Batfoxkid](https://github.com/Batfoxkid)**, the creators of ***[TF2 Zombie Riot](https://github.com/artvin01/TF2-Zombie-Riot)***, which was my inspiration for creating the Portable NPC System. Practically the entire thing was written by reverse-engineering Zombie Riot to pick out the parts I needed, then building on it by adding the CFG system and all the forwards/natives. Without these two, the Portable NPC System would never have come to exist in the first place; they deserve just as much credit as I do for this thing, if not more.
- **[Kenzzer](https://github.com/Kenzzer)**, the creator of **[CBaseNPC](https://github.com/TF2-DMB/CBaseNPC?tab=readme-ov-file)**, without which none of this would even have been possible.

## *Known Bugs/Limitations*
- Huntsman arrows are not able to headshot NPCs.
- Afterburn does not perform identically against NPCs as it does against players. It is very close, but certain small details such as afterburn duration scaling with flamethrower hit time or spelled flamethrowers making the afterburn flames green do not work.
