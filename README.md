## *Installation Guide*
TODO: Write this.

## *Prerequisites*
- **[SourceMod V1.12+](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=dev)**
- **[CBaseNPC](https://github.com/TF2-DMB/CBaseNPC?tab=readme-ov-file)**

## *Special thanks to...*
  - - **[Artvin](https://github.com/artvin01)** and **[Batfoxkid](https://github.com/Batfoxkid)**, the creators of ***[TF2 Zombie Riot](https://github.com/artvin01/TF2-Zombie-Riot)***, which was my inspiration for creating the Portable NPC System. Practically the entire thing was written by reverse-engineering Zombie Riot to pick out the parts I needed, then building on it by adding the CFG system and all the forwards/natives. Without these two, the Portable NPC System would never have come to exist in the first place; they deserve just as much credit as I do for this thing, if not more.
  - - **[Kenzzer](https://github.com/Kenzzer)**, the creator of **[CBaseNPC](https://github.com/TF2-DMB/CBaseNPC?tab=readme-ov-file)**, without which none of this would even have been possible.
